In the `bilateral-filtering` directory, reslicing and 3D and 2D bilateral filtering are implemented. The project has a separate report explaining the steps taken and quantitatively evaluating the tasks' performance.

`resizing-filtering` explores applying a smoothing filter to a 3D image before resizing. In addition, `transformation-DDFs` translates and rotates the image using Dense Displacement Fields.

`divide-triangular-meshes` divides and visualises a segmented volume.
