# Image Processing Projects
The following image manipulation tasks are performed:
* In the `bilateral-filtering` directory, non-orthogonal reslicing and 3D and 2D bilateral filtering are implemented. Contains a report explaining the taken steps and evaluating the task's performance.
* The `resizing-filtering` directory explores the application of a Gaussian filter before resizing and the effect of aliasing.
* The `transformation-DDFs` directory applies composed and sequential linear transformations to an image using Dense Displacement Fields.
* The `divide-triangular-meshes` directory builds and splits a surface mesh from a segmented image.
